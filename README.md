# IS601.Midterm

Plan of Action
1. Setting up an initial GitHub Repository and a Python Project Structure
2. Implementing the REPL
-To check if the REPL is running use this: python main. py 
-Possible Commands to test: add 4 5, subtract 10 3, multiply 100 3, divide 5 0 and divide 10 5
-Type exit to exit out of the REPL
3. Creating a Plugin System
- To check if Plugin System is working we also use python main.py
-Commands will be same as REPL = (add,subtract, multiply, divide)
-Now we will have the option to view history, save_history, load_history and clear_history
4. Managing History with Pandas 
5. Setting Up Logging 
6. Implementing Design Patterns 
7. Testing and Ensuring Code Quality
8. Documentation and Video Presentation
