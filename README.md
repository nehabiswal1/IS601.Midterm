# IS601.Midterm

#Plan of Action


#1. Setting up an initial GitHub Repository and a Python Project Structure

#2. Implementing the REPL
- To check if the REPL is running use this: python main. py 
- Possible Commands to test: add 4 5, subtract 10 3, multiply 100 3, divide 5 0 and divide 10 5
- Type exit to exit out of the REPL

#3. Creating a Plugin System
- To check if Plugin System is working we also use python main.py
- Commands will be same as REPL = (add,subtract, multiply, divide)
- Now we will have the option to view history, save_history, load_history and clear_history

#4. Managing History with Pandas 
- Similar to Plugin System, we are utilizing Pandas to manage history

#5. Setting Up Logging 
- Imported logging as well as dotenv

#6. Testing and Ensuring Code Quality
- hello testing

#7. Documentation and Video Presentation
- Implementation of the Design Patterns
- Environment Variables Used
